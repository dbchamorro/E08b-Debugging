# E08b-Debugging

For this assignment I was tasked with debugging this program. There are 8 errors of various types within the program. 

1/8 - 

2/8-Fixed the issue of the player no being able to move right, not responding to the right key

3/8- Fixed the issue of the score card not popping up. 

4/8- Fixed the issue of the enemy node not appearing on screen, and reformated the script to allow it to be killed when stepped on.

5/8- (I dont know if it was actually a problem?) I lowered the gravity of the actor to make the jumps easier to make without requirirng the player to interact with an enemy.

6/8- Updated the score card, it now starts from zero and adds 100 per coin collected, and enemy stomped on.

7/8- Fixed the issue of the endscreen not showing up when a player wins the game. 

8/8- Fixed the death counter, it added 10 each time a player died instead one.
