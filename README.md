# E08b-Debugging

For this assignment I was tasked with debugging this program. There are 8 errors of various types within the program. 

1/8 - 

2/8-

3/8- Fixed the issue of the score card not popping up. 

4/8- Fixed the issue of the enemy node not appearing on screen, and reformated the script to allow it to be killed when stepped on.

5/8- (I dont know if it was actually a problem?) I lowered the gravity of the actor to make the jumps easier to make without requirirng the player to interact with an enemy.
